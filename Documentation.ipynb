    "\n",
    "### Database building\n",
    "The RNA-seq data (a fastq or fasta file), given by the -fq or -fa option, is formatted into a BLAST database, whose  name is given by the -d option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reads contained in this file will all be used, so the file must be clean up. PAS CLAIR POUR MOI.\n",
    "If this file is a fastq file, it will be converted into a fasta file. This conversion can take a lot of time (between XX and YY hours on a laptop). \n",
    "\n",
    "As the database building step is time consuming, if a BLAST database is already present, the database building will be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative process\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence in the query file (-q option) will serve as the first bait sequence. DIRE ICI SI POSSIBLE D'EN METTRE PLUSIEURS OU UNE SEULE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A classical iteration (see Figure XX)\n",
    "*    Reads recruting (Blast):\n",
    "\n",
    "     Bait sequences are used to recrute homologous reads by BLAST. The -e option allows fixing the evalue threshold.\n",
    "     If the data is paired-end (-dt option), all paired reads are added to the read list. WARNING: Paired read names must end with 1 or 2.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "*    Read assembly (Trinity):\n",
    "\n",
    "     All reads present in the read list are assembled (de novo) by Trinity. XX PAS CLAIR POUR MOI : If the data contains paired-end reads, Trinity takes reads as paired reads.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "*    Reconstructed sequences quality (Exonerate):\n",
    "\n",
    "     Exonerate is used to align each sequence to the reference. The length of the sequence, the length of the alignment, the percentage of identity, the alignment score are collected.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "*    Reconstructed sequence filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Reconstructed sequences are filtered according to the option -id -mal -len. Sequences which pass all filters are used as bait sequences for the next iteration.\n",

    "*    Coverage calculation (Mafft):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria to stop the iterative process\n",
    "If one of these criteria is completed during an iteration, the iterative process will stop.\n",
    "The following criteria are implemented as default settings : \n",
    "*    The number of max iteration (-i option) is attained.\n",
    "*    Recruted reads are the same as during the previous iteration.\n",
    "*    Reconstructed sequences at the end of an iteration are almost the same as after the previous iteration. That means each sequence of an iteration has a corresponding sequence in the previous iteration with at least 99% identity and 98% of its length.\n",
    "*    The number of reconstructed sequences has not changed AND the total length, score and LargeCoverage of all reconstructed sequences have not been improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the --required_coverage option is used, the iterating process will stop if the Strict coverage is superior to the Required_coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these criteria are not applied if the --finish_all_iteration is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "A final filter (-fmal -fid -flen option) can be applied on the reconstructed sequences to be more stringent than the threshold used during the iterative process. \n",
    "\n",
